3-Tier DevSecOps Project
This repository contains a simple Node.js API and a React client used for a user management demo. Follow the steps below to get the project running locally.

Setup
Install Node.js (version 18 or later is recommended).

Install dependencies for both the API and client:

cd api && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
Start the API server:

In a separate terminal, start the React client:

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to use the application.

The client now displays an animated banner welcoming you to DevOps Shack.
